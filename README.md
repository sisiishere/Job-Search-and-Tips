# Job-Search-and-TipsGetting Started
This first project is about searching for a particular job along with the information and the video on the certain job provided.
First off, a person types in the job one desires.
Secondly, one should get some job listings on that certain job.
Then, there's information provided about the certain job via Wikipedia API.
And also, there is a video on the certain job from the Youtube API.
And that's basically how the Job Search App works.
